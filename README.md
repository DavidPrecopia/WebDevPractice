# WebDevPractice
A repo to practice and develop our programming skills.

## Signing your commits
This repo's `main` branch will block commits that are not signed. Signing, as the name suggests, verifies that the commit comes from person it claims to be from. You'll need to create a GPG on your computer and add the public version of it to your GitHub account. I can disable this rule if we feel it is too much of a PIA to get working.

#### How to:
